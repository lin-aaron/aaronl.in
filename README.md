### A little about me
  I'm Aaron Lin, a second-year undergrad at UC Berkeley, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. You can take a look at some of my work on [Github](https://github.com/lin-aaron/), and link with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/aaronlin6)! 

I'll be updating this site in the winter, so stay updated! I don't know what I'll do with this space, but for now, find below:
