## You've reached Aaron's website!!
### A little about me
  I'm Aaron Lin, a second-year undergrad at UC Berkeley, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. You can take a look at some of my work on [Github](https://github.com/lin-aaron/), and link with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/aaron-lin8)! 

I'll be updating this site in the winter, so watch out world!!!! I don't know what I'll do with this space, but for now, find below:

### Things I'm looking forward to doing over break:
* Play [Reverie, by Claude Debussy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqXwzUW_fhM) on piano. [(sheet music here)](http://ks.petruccimusiclibrary.org/files/imglnks/usimg/9/97/IMSLP14012-Debussy_-_R%C3%AAverie_(piano).pdf)

* Try the first of the [Deux Arabesques, by Claude Debussy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh36PaE-Pf0). [(sheet music here)](http://ks.petruccimusiclibrary.org/files/imglnks/usimg/3/37/IMSLP02821-Debussy-L066.pdf)

* Go snowboarding in Tahoe!!!!! And shredding that fresh powder!! (Just kidding I'm not that good at snowboarding yet)

* Work on a cool translation project to translate and speak text on a website. It's been done before but I want to try my hand at it. It would be helpful for learning new languages by immersing yourself in the language, while also having a bit of a crutch, to help with pronunciation or definitions. 
  * Maybe on hover and a key press, you could do a quick google search for an image/definition in the language?

* Get excited for next semester's classes.... :) What's planned is:
  * __CS 186__, Databases, because jobs maybe???
  * __EECS 126__, Probability and Random Processes, because math is important :^)
  * __EE 198__, HANDS ON HAM RADIO LICENSING!!!! To basically become a master of radio waves, no biggie.
  * __Anthro R1B__, Reading and Writing about Anthropology. I don't know what the topic of the class is yet, but hopefully it's interesting.
  * __CS 195__, Social Implications of Computing. Taught by the one and only [Joshua Hug](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/joshhug.html) so you know it's gonna be a great class. Also because security and privacy is becoming such a huge issue as we keep hearing about in the media, and the fact that technology/social media is [changing the very fabric of society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1281&v=PMotykw0SIk) faster than we can begin to comprehend keeps me up at night. But mainly Josh Hug because he is a blessing to us all. 
  * __CS 189__, Intro to Machine Learning (verrrry strong maybe) Probably not going to take this but for some reason I still put myself on the waitlist  *during Phase I* (smh @ the time I thought 189 would fit into the workload above, a mere four weeks ago).


## I should probably get back to studying for finals now haha bye
